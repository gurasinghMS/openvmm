//! A collection of end-to-end VMM tests.
//!
//! Tests should contain both the name of the firmware and the guest they are
//! using, so that our test runners can easily filter them.
//!
//! If you use the #[vmm_test] macro then all of the above requirements
//! are handled for you automatically.
//!
//! Not all tests are expected to work in all scenarios. For example, Hyper-V
//! tests do not work in WSL and TDX tests require a TDX-capable CPU.

// Tests that run on more than one architecture.

// compile when targeting any architecture. As our ARM64 support improves
// these tests should be able to someday run on both x86-64 and ARM64, and be
// moved into a multi-arch module.
